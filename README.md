# OCB Dice Roll Modlet - 7 Days to Die Addon

This mod only provides a command line interface to perform
dice rolls (or what items can be looted from containers).
It sole purpose is to help modders to fine tune their loot.
Also useful to gather loot stats from the vanilla game.

List loot groups:
`dr list [search]`

Roll dice once for garbage at stage 2:
`dr once garbage 2`

Roll 20 dices for junk at stage 1:
`dr roll 20 junk 1`

Search what yields an item (takes long!):
`dr search drinkYuccaJuiceSmoothie`

Get average of 20k runs at stage 1:
`dr avg iceMachine drinkYuccaJuiceSmoothie 20000 1`
